# Find_me_game
This is a game for a school assignment in seconary school, and takes insperation from the Wanted minigame from Mario

In the game, there will be an eye in the middle, and 3 buttons to click on.
The goal is to acumulate as manny points as posible, through clicking the
button with the same collor as the eye's iris.

You get +2 seconds for every corect click, and get -5 seconds for every incorect click.
If i have extra time, i may add more buttons to click, as well as randomixe between iris and X
(when x appears, you have to click on another button than the one with the same collor)

For today, I have finnished adding in my progress from another computer, onto the repo.
For the next log, I will try to fix the loading screen so that it loades one page at a time.
But not before adding comments where necesary.
Have a nice day

For today, I have continued filing on the load sequence, as well as started progress on game articel.
The plan I have right now is to dedicate 1 weak on game section, half a week on the game over section and use the remaining time to file the game. Like add countdown(Will probably do that today), add X feature(Don't click on the color the X displays), and maby more collors

For the final 3 days of the assignment, I will begin on a documentation document, summarizing all that i've done, as well as future aspirations with the program(if there are anny)

Have a nice day!

For today, i have strugled with the click function. it worked partially, but only on gteen.
The change i commited did not seem to work, because the start collor was always going to be
incorect.

For the next log, i will try to fix the on click function for the buttons. Hopefully, the road after
that should be an easy one. If anyone wants to help aid in the project then feel free to do so. Just do the work on your own branch, and show it to me before merging.

Have a nice day!
