But not before adding comments where necesary.

For today, I have continued filing on the load sequence, as well as started progress on game articel.
The plan I have right now is to dedicate 1 weak on game section, half a week on the game over section and use the remaining time to file the game. Like add countdown(Will probably do that today), add X feature(Don't click on the color the X displays), and maby more collors

For the final 3 days of the assignment, I will begin on a documentation document, summarizing all that i've done, as well as future aspirations with the program(if there are anny)

Have a nice day!
